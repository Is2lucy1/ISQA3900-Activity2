        I put parenthesis around "Lu" because my middle nap is actually self-declared. While all of my other family members seem to have middle names,
        my mother may have forgetten to give me one.  Not to worry though, she has been forgiven. The child bearing process is no easy feat for us homo sapiens 
        and I'm glad to be given the chance at life so frankly, people can call me whatever they like.

        This is my first semester as a graduate student in the IT Innovation program. I came from just right down the street (Creighton University) 
        where I got my undergraduate degree in neuroscience. In order to expand my career prospects, I felt that this masters program
        will give me both technical and business skills required to succeed in any field because technology is guaranteed to overlap!
        <br>
        <br>
        In this class, I'm hoping to really improve my intermediate Python coding skills and add more useful tools into my repository that could help 
        me succeed in the future.  While technology is my career passion, I also have interests in poetry, the liberal arts, science, our education system, 
        health, medicine, <em>our healthcare system</em>, stocks, death, and even my future parenting style to name a few!
