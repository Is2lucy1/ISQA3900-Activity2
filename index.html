        I put paranthesis around "Lu" because my middle nap is actually self-declared. While all of my other family members seem to have middle names,
        my mother may have forgetten to give me one. She has been forgiven though because the child bearing process is no easy feat for us homo sapiens.

        This is my first semester as a graduate student in the IT Innovation program. I came from just right down the street
        where I got my undergraduate degree in neuroscience. In order to expand my career prospects, I felt that this masters program
        will give me both technical and business skills required to succeed in any field where technology is guaranteed to overlap!
