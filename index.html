            <p>

            I am a graduate student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha starting my first semester in IT Innovation. 
            I recieved my undergraduate in Neuroscience and wanted to create more career opportunities for myself so I'm 
            hoping to tie my background in science by adding technical and management skills in technology.  
            
            I have self-taught myself C++, Python and now creating my first HTML webpage. I am currently having difficulties with 
            getting my image to show. :(

            I am currently brainstorming ideas for a semester project and cannot wait to work with Steven and Dan again as they 
            are reliable and hardworking students and great individuals overall!
