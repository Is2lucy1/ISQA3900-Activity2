    <p>
        I am a graduate student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha starting my first semester in IT Innovation.
        I am hoping to tie my background in science by adding technical and management skills in technology.
        <br>
        I have self-taught myself C++, Python and now creating my first HTML webpage. I am currently having difficulties with 
        getting my image to show. :(
